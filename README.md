# About [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/CraigChilds94/plaid-php.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/CraigChilds94/plaid-php)

This is an unofficial http://plaid.com PHP SDK. It doesn't cover the entire API (yet) but it provides the interface to communicate with Plaid and do some basic functions.

## Testing

Please rename `.env.example` to `.env.testing` and populate it with your real-keys to run the test suite.

To run the test suite ensure that your composer dependencies are installed `composer install` and run `phpunit` in the root of the project.
